## About me
I am a Ph.D. student working with [Prof. Tilman Wolf](http://www.ecs.umass.edu/ece/wolf/) at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/).  My research interests focus on computer networks and machine learning.  Before joining UMass, I obtained my master's degree from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) in Germany, advised by [Prof. Thomas Eibert](https://www.ei.tum.de/en/hft/people/professors/prof-dr-ing-thomas-eibert/prof-dr-ing-thomas-eibert/).
