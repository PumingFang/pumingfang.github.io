Book Review: Unfair Advantage by Robert Kiyosaki 
======
*In this book, Robert underscores his messages and challenges readers to change their context and act in a new way. Readers are advised to stop blindly accepting that they are ‘disadvantaged’ people with limited options. They are encouraged to act beyond their concept of limited options and challenge the preconception that they will struggle financially all of their lives.*

Unfair Advantage #1: Knowledge
-----
The author firmly believes that in the world of fake money. Knowledge is real money.

Before you make your money, you need to protect it.

Taking classes on advertising, gold, options trading, writing sales letters, foreign-exchange trading, creative financing, foreclosures, asset protection is a good idea.

Three important lessons:
1. Start small. Dream big. Look at 100 properties before buying one. Most investments are bad investments, so you need to invest time looking for those rare great deals.
2. Look for cash flow. The more investments you have the more cash flow you generate.
3. Have people send money to you. The financial education taught in schools teaches kids to send their money to the government, retail banks, and investment banks. True financial education teaches you how to have people send money to you.

Unfair Advantage #2: Taxes
-----

Picture below is the CASHFLOW Quadrant which defines the different players in the world of money.

It is important to note that taxes are defined by quadrant, not by profession. Again, a doctor can be a doctor in all four quadrants. Different quadrants follow different tax rules.

The people in the E and S quadrants pay the highest taxes.
1. Earned income: highest-taxed income
2. Portfolio income: second highest-taxed income
3. Passive income: lowest-taxed income, possible zero

The easiest way to start to change quadrants is to change your friends. This does not mean you should dump your old friends, of course. It means you should meet new people and expand your world if you want to change your life.
1. The harder you work for money, the more you pay in taxes.
2. The harder your money works for you, the less you pay in taxes.
3. The harder other people’s money works for you, the less you pay in taxes. In fact, you may pay nothing, zero, zip, nada, in taxes.

Unfair Advantage #3: Debt
-----
If we stop borrowing, the economy stops running because today all money is debt.

The financial world loves debtors and punishes savers.

The fractional reserve system of banking destroys the purchasing power of your savings.

The advice is to use debt as acquired assets instead of liabilities.

Unfair Advantage #4: Risk
-----
K.B explains that by avoiding risk, people lead lives of extreme risk.

These three courses are important for people who want to be in the B and I quadrants. These three courses reduced your risk and increased your control in the B and I quadrants.
1. Learn to sell (control income)
2. Learn to invest in real estate (control debt)
3. Learn technical investing (control markets)

Unfair Advantage #5: Compensation
-----
Rather than work for money, the rich follow the Laws of Compensation.

1. Reciprocity: Give and you shall receive.
   If you cheat people they will give back what you gave them.
2. Learn to give more.
   When a person is successful in serving more people, taxes in debt also swing to their favor. 
3. Leverage the power of compounding financial education.
   Over time, as your education compounds, so do your returns.
   
When you meet smarter people, you are invested into investments that are called “insider” investments.

**In closing: It is by being generous that we find our God-given gifts and our God-given genius.**
