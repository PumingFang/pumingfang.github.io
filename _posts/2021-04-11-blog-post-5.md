Book Review: David and Goliath by Malcolm Gladwell
======
*When confronting powerful opponents, instead of wondering if they have more power than you, the question you should be asking yourself is if there is a way that you can play by your own rules.*

> “Three thousand years ago on a battlefield in ancient Palestine, a shepherd boy felled a mighty warrior with nothing more than a stone and a sling, and ever since then the names of David and Goliath have stood for battles between underdogs and giants. ”

This book is not David vs. Goliath, but David and Goliath.
