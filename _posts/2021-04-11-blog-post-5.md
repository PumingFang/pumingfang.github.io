Book Review: David and Goliath by Malcolm Gladwell
======
*When confronting powerful opponents, instead of wondering if they have more power than you, the question you should be asking yourself is if there is a way that you can play by your own rules.*

> “Three thousand years ago on a battlefield in ancient Palestine, a shepherd boy felled a mighty warrior with nothing more than a stone and a sling, and ever since then the names of David and Goliath have stood for battles between underdogs and giants. ”

In this book, Malcolm talks about David and Goliath, not David vs Goliath. He explains how we all have our strengths and weaknesses and how we can use them to our advantage to get our way through this world. 

The Advantages of Disadvantages & The Disadvantages of Advantages
------
Malcolm begins with some examples of how some underdogs succeed.

Ranadivé coached a basketball team that had no experience and was not particularly talented, but they became champions by playing an unorthodox style of defense. This strategy caught other teams off guard. They won the games because they are using their strengths instead of trying to compensate for their weaknesses. Once they stopped playing this new way, they lost.

Malcolm tells us that people shouldn’t assume that something is an advantage or a disadvantage because it may be different in each situation. For example, small class sizes are often considered positive for students, but there are some teachers who like larger classes because it’s easier to engage all of the students when there aren’t as many children in the room. 

Play your Game

**By putting out advantage, we hide our disadvantage.**
