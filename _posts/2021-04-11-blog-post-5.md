Book Review: Start with Why by Simon Sinek
======
*"People don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it."-Simon Sinek*

>  “Instead of asking, “WHAT should we do to compete?” the questions must be asked, “WHY did we start doing WHAT we’re doing in the first place, and WHAT can we do to bring our cause to life considering all the technologies and market opportunities available today?”
